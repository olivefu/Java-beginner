# Java-beginner
These are the exercises I have done to make me more familiar with Java. I am a Java beginner :)

This program aims at solving problem below:

Write a program in Java that sorts a set of strings like a dictionary with ascending order. The input should be N and M lines of strings. The results should be sorted in ascending order of the output string on the line.

Example:
Input:
3
Abc
Abe
Abd
Output:
Abc
Abd
Abe
